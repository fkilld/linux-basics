* **who** It is used to get information about currently logged in user on to system. If you don\'t provide any option or arguments, the command displays the following information for each logged-in user.

    1. Login name of the user
    2. User terminal
    3. Date & Time of login
    4. Remote host name of the user

```bash
$ who

## # 2. Directory Commands

1. **pwd** The pwd ( Present Working Directory ) command is used to print the name of the present/current working directory starting from the root.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/sj/Desktop/Linux
```

2. **mkdir** The mkdir ( make directory ) command allows users to create directories or folders.

```bash
$ mkdir ubuntu
$ ls
ubuntu
```

The option '-p' is used to create multiple directories or parent directories at once.

```bash
$ mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3
$ cd dir1/dir2/dir3
~/Desktop/Linux/dir1/dir2/dir3$
```

3. **rmdir**: The rmdir ( remove directories ) is used to remove _empty_ directories. Can be used to delete multiple empty directories as well. Safer to use compared to `rm -r FolderName`. This command can also be forced to delete non-empty directories.

   1. Remove empty directory:

```bash
rmdir FolderName
```

   2. Remove multiple directories:

```bash
rmdir FolderName1 FolderName2 FolderName3
```

   3. Remove non-empty directories:

```bash
rmdir FolderName1 --ignore-fail-on-non-empty
```

   4. Remove entire directory tree. This command is similar to `rmdir a/b/c a/b a`:

```bash
rmdir -p a/b/c
```

4. **rm**: The rm ( remove ) command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links etc from the file system.
   1. Remove file: The rm command is used to remove or delete a file

```bash
rm file_name
```

2. Remove file forcefully: The rm command with -f option is used for removal of file without prompting for confirmation.

```bash
rm -f filename
```

3. Remove directory: The rm command with -r option is used to remove the directory and its contents recursively.

```bash
rm -r myDir
```

4. Remove directory forcefully: The rm command with -rf option is used to forcefully remove directory recursively.

```bash
rm -rf myDir
```

5. **touch**: The touch command is is used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file without any content.
   1. **Create a new file:** You can create a single file at a time using touch command. The file created is an empty file.
       ```bash
       touch file_name
       ```
   2. **Create multiple files:** You can create the multiple numbers of files at the same time.
       ```bash
       touch file1_name file2_name file3_name
       ```
   3. **Change access time:** The touch command with `a` option is used to change the access time of a file.
       ```bash
       touch -a file_name
       ```
   4. **Change modification time:** The touch command with `m` option is used to change the modified time.
       ```bash
       touch -m file_name
       ```
   5. **Use timestamp of other file:** The touch command with `r` option is used to get timestamp of another file.
       ```bash
       touch -r file2 file1
       ```

       In the above example, we get the timestamp of file1 for file2.

   6. **Create file with Specific time:** The touch command with 't' option is used to create a file with specified time.
       ```bash
       touch -t 1911010000 file_name
       ```
6. **cat**: The cat command is used to create single or multiple files, view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.

   1. **View file contents:** You can view contents of a single or more files by mentioning the filenames.

       ```bash
       cat file_name1 file_name2
       ```

## # 4. File Permissions

* chmod octal file – change the permissions of file to octal, which can be found separately for user, group, and world by adding
* 4 – read (r)
* 2 – write (w)
* 1 – execute (x)

### Examples

* `chmod 777` – read, write, execute for all
* `chmod 755` – rwx for owner, rx for group and world

Since Linux is a multi-user operating system, it is necessary to provide security to prevent people from accessing each other’s confidential files.
So Linux divides authorization into 2 levels,

1. **Ownership:**
Each file or directory has assigned with 3 types of owners
i. **User:** Owner of the file who created it.
ii. **Group:** Group of users with the same access permissions to the file or directory.
iii. **Other:** Applies to all other users on the system

2. **Permissions:**
Each file or directory has following permissions for the above 3 types of owners.

    i.   **Read:** Give you the authority to open and read a file and lists its content for a directory.

    ii.  **Write:** Give you the authority to modify the contents of a file and add, remove and rename files stored in the directory.

    iii. **Execute:** Give you the authority to run the program in Unix/Linux.

     The permissions are indicated with below characters,

         r = read permission

         w = write permission

         x = execute permission

         \- = no permission

    The above authorization levels represented in a diagram

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/permissions.png" width="350px">
</p>

There is a need to restrict own file/directory access to others.

**Change access:**
The `chmod` command is used to change the access mode of a file.  This command is used to set permissions ( read, write, execute ) on a file/directory for the owner, group and the others group.

```cmd
chmod [reference][operator][mode] file...

Example
chmod ugo-rwx test.txt
```

There are 2 ways to use this command,

1. **Absolute mode:**
The file permissions will be represented in a three-digit octal number.

     The possible permissions types represented in a number format as below.

     | Permission Type | Number |  Symbol |
     | ------------- | ----- | ----- |
     | No Permission | 0 | --- |
     | Execute | 1 | --x |
     | Write | 2 | -w- |
     | Execute + Write | 3 | -wx |
     | Read | 4 | r-- |
     | Read + Execute | 5 | r-x |
     | Read + Write | 6 | rw- |
     | Read + Write + Execute | 7 | rwx |


Let's update the permissions in absolute mode with an example as below,

   ```cmd
    chmode 764 test.txt
   ```

2. **Symbolic mode:**
In the symbolic mode, you can modify permissions of a specific owner unlike absolute mode.

    The owners are represented as below,

     | Owner | Description |
     | ----- | ----- |
     | u | user/owner |
     | g | group |
     | o | other |
     | a | all |

    and the list of mathematical symbols to modify the file permissions as follows,

     | Operator | Description |
     | ------------- | ----- |
     | + | Adds permission |
     | - | Removes the permission |
     | = | Assign the permission |

**Changing Ownership and Group:**
It is possible to change the the ownership and group of a file/directory using `chown` command.

```cmd
chown user filename
chown user:group filename

Example:
chown John test.txt
chown John:Admin test.txt
```

**Change group-owner only:**
Sometimes you may need to change group owner only. In this case, chgrp command need to be used

```cmd
chgrp group_name filename

Example:
sudo chgrp Administrator test.txt
```

| # | Permission              | rwx | Binary |
| - | -                       | -   | -      |
| 7 | read, write and execute | rwx | 111    |
| 6 | read and write          | rw- | 110    |
| 5 | read and execute        | r-x | 101    |
| 4 | read only               | r-- | 100    |
| 3 | write and execute       | -wx | 011    |
| 2 | write only              | -w- | 010    |
| 1 | execute only            | --x | 001    |
| 0 | none                    | --- | 000    |

For a directory, execute means you can enter a directory.

| User | Group | Others | Description                                                                                          |
| -    | -     | -      | -                                                                                                    |
| 6    | 4     | 4      | User can read and write, everyone else can read ( Default file permissions )                           |
| 7    | 5     | 5      | User can read, write and execute, everyone else can read and execute ( Default directory permissions ) |

- u - User
- g - Group
- o - Others
- a - All of the above

```bash
ls -l /foo.sh            # List file permissions
chmod +100 foo.sh        # Add 1 to the user permission
chmod -100 foo.sh        # Subtract 1 from the user permission
chmod u+x foo.sh         # Give the user execute permission
chmod g+x foo.sh         # Give the group execute permission
chmod u-x,g-x foo.sh     # Take away the user and group execute permission
chmod u+x,g+x,o+x foo.sh # Give everybody execute permission
chmod a+x foo.sh         # Give everybody execute permission
chmod +x foo.sh          # Give everybody execute permission
```

## # 10. SSH

SSH ( Secure Shell ) is a network protocol that enables secure remote connections between two systems.

1.  **Connect remote machine using IP address or machine name:** The remote server can be connected with local user name using either host name or IP address

```cmd
ssh <host-name> or <ip-address>

Example:
ssh 192.111.66.100
ssh test.remoteserver.com
```

2.  **Connect remote machine using username:** It is also possible specify a user for an SSH connection.

```cmd
ssh username@hostname_or_ip-address

Example:
ssh john@192.0.0.22
ssh john@test.remoteserver.com
```

3.  **:Connect remote machine using custom port** By default, the SSH server listens for a connection on port 22. But you can also specify the custom port.

```cmd
ssh <host-name> or <ip-address> -p port_number

Example:
ssh test.remoteserver.com -p 3322
```

4.  **Generate SSH keys using keygen:** SSH Keygen is used to generate a key pair which consists of public and private keys to improve the security of SSH connections.

```cmd
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

5.  **Copying SSH keys to servers:** For SSH authentication, `ssh-copy-id` command will be used to copy public key ( id_rsa.pub ) to server.

```cmd
ssh-copy-id hostname_or_IP
```

6.  **Copy a File Remotely over SSH:** SCP tool is used to securely copy files over the SSH protocol.

```cmd
scp fileName user@remotehost:destinationPath

Example:

## # 12. Vi Editor

Vi editor is the most popular text editor from the early days of Unix. Whereas Vim ( Vi IMproved ) is an improved version of vi editor to be used in CLI ( command line interface ) for mainly text editing tasks in many configuration files. Some of the other alternatives are Elvis, Nvi, Nano, Joe, and Vile.
It has two main operation modes,

1.  **Command Mode:** It allows the entry of commands to manipulate text.
2.  **Entry mode ( Or Insert mode ):** It allows typed characters on the keyboard into the current file.

#### 1. Start with Vi Editor

You can create a new file or open an existing file using `vi filename` command.

```cmd
 vi <filename_NEW> or <filename_EXISTING> // Create a new file or open an existing file

 Example:
 vi first.txt
```

Let's see how do you create file, enter the content and leave the CLI by saving the changes.

1.  Create a new file named `first.txt`
2.  Press `i` to enter the insert mode
3.  Enter the text "Hello World!"
4.  Save the text and exit by pressing `:wq!` command
5.  Check the entered text

#### 2. Cursor movement

    These commands will be used in Command mode.

##### Move cursor

You can use arrow keys ( left, right, up and down ) to move the cursor on the terminal. But you can also other keys for this behavior.

```cmd
 h        # Move left
 j        # Move down
 k        # Move up
 l        # Move right
```

##### Jump one word

These commands used to jump one word at a time

```cmd
w        # Jump forwards to the start of a word
W        # Jump forwards to the start of a WORD
e        # Jump forwards to the start of a word
E        # Jump forwards to the start of a WORD
b        # Jump backwords to the start of a word
B        # Jump backwords to the start of a WORD
```

##### Jump to start or end of a line or next line

These commands used to jump starting or ending of a line or a next line.

```cmd
^        # Jump to the start of a current line
$        # Jump to the end of a current line
return   # Jump to the start of a next line
```

##### Move sides

These commands used to moves all sides of the screen

```cmd
Backspace # Move cursor one character to the left
Spacebar  # Move cursor one character to the right
H ( High )   # Move cursor to the top of the screen
M ( Middle ) # Move cursor to the middle of the screen
L ( Low )    # Move cursor to the bottom of the screen
```

##### Paging and Scrolling

Paging is used to moves the cursor up or down through the text a full screen at a time. Whereas Scrolling happens line by line.

```cmd
Ctrl + f     # move forward one full screen
Ctrl + b     # move backward one full screen
Ctrl + d     # move forward half a screen
Ctrl + u     # move backward half a screen
```

##### Inserting Text

These commands places vi in entry mode from command mode. First, you need to be in command mode to use the below commands.

###### Insert

```cmd
i    # Insert text to the left of the cursor
I    # Insert text at the beginning of a line
ESC  # Exit insert mode
```

###### Append

```cmd
a    # Insert ( or Append ) text to the right of the cursor
A    # Insert ( or Append ) text at the end of a line
```

###### Open a line

```cmd
o    # Open a line below the current cursor position
O    # open a line above the current cursor position
```

##### Editing Text

1. **Change word:** Change word/part of word to right of cursor

    ```cmd
    cw
    ```

2. **Change line** Change entire line

    ```cmd
    cc
    ```

3. **Change line from specific character** Change from cursor to end of line

    ```cmd
    C
    ```

##### Deleting Text

1. **Deleting One Character:** Position the cursor over the character to be deleted and type x

    ```cmd
    x
    X       //To delete one character before the cursor
    ```
2. **Deleting a Word:** Position the cursor at the beginning of the word and type dw

    ```cmd
    dw
    ```
3. **Deleting a Line:** Position the cursor anywhere on the line and type dd.

    ```cmd
    dd
    ```

##### Cut, Copy & Paste

   Copy, Cut and Paste operations can be done in either Normal or visual Mode.

1. **Normal mode:** This mode appears on click of `Esc` key.

   **Copy** There are various copy or yank commands based on amount of text to be copied. The `y` character is used to perform this operation.

   i. Copy an entire line: Just place the cursor at the beginning of the line and type `yy`

   ```cmd
   yy
   ```

   ii.Copy three lines: Just place the cursor from where to start copying and type `3yy`

   ```cmd
   3yy
   ```

   iii. Copy word with trailing whitespace: Place the cursor at the beginning of the word and type `yaw`

   ```cmd
   yaw
   ```

   iv. Copy word without trailing whitespace: Place the cursor at the beginning of the word and type `yiw`.

   ```cmd
   yiw
   ```

   v. Copy right of the cursor: Copy text right of the cursor to the end of line using `y$` command

   ```cmd
   y$
   ```

   vi.Copy left of the cursor: Copy text left of the cursor to the end of line using `y^` command

   ```cmd
   y^
   ```

   vii. Copy text between the cursor and character: Copy text between the cursor and specified character.

   ```cmd
   ytx ( Copy until x and x is excluded )
   yfx ( Copy until x and x is included )
   ```

   **Cut** There are various cutting or deleting commands based on amount of text to be deleted. The `d` character is used to perform this operation.

   i. Cut entire line: Cut the entire line where the cursor is located

   ```cmd
   dd
   ```

   ii.Cut three lines: Cut the three lines starting from the place where cursor is located

   ```cmd
   3dd
   ```

   iii.Cut right of the cursor: Cut the text from the right of the cursor till the end of line

   ```cmd
   d$
   ```

   iii.Cut left of the cursor: Cut the text from the left of the cursor till the beginning of line

   ```cmd
   d^
   ```

   **Paste** This operation is performed using `p` command to paste the selected text

   ```cmd
   p
   ```

2. **Visual Mode** In this mode, first select the text using below keys

    1. v ( lowercase ): To select individual characters
    2. V ( uppercase ): To select the entire line
    3. Ctrl+v: To select by block

    and perform copy, cut and paste operations using y,d and p commands

##### Exiting

    These commands are used to exit from the file.
    ```cmd
    :w	    # Write (save) the file, but don't exit
    :wq	    # Write (save) and quit
    :wq!	# Force write (save) and quit
    :q	    # Quit, but it fails if anything has changed
    :q!	    # Quit and throw away for any changes
    ```

type wget                                  # Find the binary
which wget                                 # Find the binary
whereis wget                               # Find the binary, source, and manual page files
```

`locate` uses an index and is fast.

```bash
updatedb                                   # Update the index

locate foo.txt                             # Find a file
locate --ignore-case                       # Find a file and ignore case
locate f*.txt                              # Find a text file starting with 'f'
```

`find` doesn't use an index and is slow.

```bash
find /path -name foo.txt                   # Find a file
find /path -iname foo.txt                  # Find a file with case insensitive search
find /path -name "*.txt"                   # Find all text files
find /path -name foo.txt -delete           # Find a file and delete it
find /path -name "*.png" -exec pngquant {} # Find all .png files and execute pngquant on it
find /path -type f -name foo.txt           # Find a file
find /path -type d -name foo               # Find a directory
find /path -type l -name foo.txt           # Find a symbolic link
find /path -type f -mtime +30              # Find files that haven't been modified in 30 days
find /path -type f -mtime +30 -delete      # Delete files that haven't been modified in 30 days

tmux ls          # List all sessions
tmux attach -t 0 # Reattach to a session

screen           # Start a new session (CTRL-a + d to detach)
screen -ls       # List all sessions
screen -R 31166  # Reattach to a session

exit             # Exit a session

## Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)

```bash
ssh hostname                 # Connect to hostname using your current user name over the default SSH port 22
ssh -i foo.pem hostname      # Connect to hostname using the identity file
ssh user@hostname            # Connect to hostname using the user over the default SSH port 22
ssh user@hostname -p 8765    # Connect to hostname using the user over a custom port
ssh ssh://user@hostname:8765 # Connect to hostname using the user over a custom port
```

Set default user and port in `~/.ssh/config`, so you can just enter the name next time:

```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host name
  User foo
  Hostname 127.0.0.1
  Port 8765
$ ssh name
